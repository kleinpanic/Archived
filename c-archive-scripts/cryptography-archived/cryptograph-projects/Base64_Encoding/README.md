# Base64 Encoder

## Description
This project implements a Base64 encoder and decoder for educational purposes. Base64 encoding converts binary data to text, using a set of 64 printable characters.

## Directory Structure
- `include/`: Contains the header files.
- `src/`: Contains the source code files (`main.c` and `base64_encoder.c`).
- `obj/`: Contains the compiled object files.
- `build/`: Contains the Makefile and the compiled binary.

## How to Build
1. Navigate to the `build` directory.
2. Run `make` to compile the project.

## How to Run
1. After building, you will find an executable named `base64_encoder` in the `build` directory.
2. Run it using `./base64_encoder`.

## How to Clean
- Run `make clean` in the `build` directory to remove all compiled files.
