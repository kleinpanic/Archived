# XOR Cipher

## Description
This project implements a simple XOR cipher for encrypting and decrypting text using a key. XOR encryption is a symmetric operation, meaning the same function is used to both encrypt and decrypt data.

## Directory Structure
- `include/`: Contains the header files.
- `src/`: Contains the source code files (`main.c` and `xor_cipher.c`).
- `obj/`: Contains the compiled object files.
- `build/`: Contains the Makefile and the compiled binary.

## How to Build
1. Navigate to the `build` directory.
2. Run `make` to compile the project.

## How to Run
1. After building, you will find an executable named `xor_cipher` in the `build` directory.
2. Run it using `./xor_cipher`.

## How to Clean
- Run `make clean` in the `build` directory to remove all compiled files.
