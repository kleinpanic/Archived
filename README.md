# 📦 Archived Projects

Welcome to the **Archived** repository—a collection of my old, incomplete, or abandoned projects. These directories contain code and ideas that I’ve set aside for various reasons, including:

- Projects that are no longer useful
- Incomplete experiments
- Concepts I’ve decided not to pursue
- Code that’s been superseded by better implementations

---

### 🔍 **Why Keep These Around?**
While these projects are no longer in active development, they might still serve as:
- A reference for past work
- A source of inspiration for future projects
- A collection of ideas that could be revisited or repurposed
